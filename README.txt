The code framework is consistent with the Supplementary Information document.

The code, named OgStH, includes functions at both the module and network levels. The system-level power system UC model can be found in the "UC" folder, where the main code is "prvcunit_main_30.m." The system-level ecohydrological model is based on the open-source Tethys-Chloris (T&C) code, accessible at https://codeocean.com/capsule/0294088/tree/v2.

Yalmip, Cplex, and Gurobi are required for execution.
